# Format: A78 Atari 7800 cartridge file format
## ".A78" Atari 7800 file data structure
The A78 header was originally created by Dan Boris, in tandem with his A7800 emulator. The header, which is added to the beginning of ROM images, serves to tell the emulator which
 hardware should be present for the game to run correctly.

The format has since been expanded to incorporate new hardware, and is now being used by multiple emulators
 and the Concerto 7800 flash cart.
